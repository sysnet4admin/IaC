                  The default is false which means traffic matching RedirectFrontend will

                      EgressIP is the source IP address that the egress traffic is SNATed
                      with.

                      Example:
                      When set to "192.168.1.100", matching egress traffic will be
                      redirected to the node matching the NodeSelector field and SNATed
                      with IP address 192.168.1.100.

                      When none of the Interface or EgressIP fields is specified, the
                      policy will use the first IPv4 assigned to the interface with the
                      default route.

                      that the traffic is SNATed with is assigned.

                      Example:
                      When set to "eth1", matching egress traffic will be redirected to the
                      node matching the NodeSelector field and SNATed with the first IPv4
                      address assigned to the eth1 interface.

                        ToFQDN allows whitelisting DNS names in place of IPs. The IPs that result
                        from DNS resolution of `ToFQDN.MatchName`s are added to the same
                        EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and
                        L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs.
                        The DNS -> IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the
                        cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy
                        for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way).
                        Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as
                        ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when
                        PolicyEnforcment=default.
                        Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the
                        ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP.
                        Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules.

                                        contains multiple topics, then all topics must be allowed or the
                                        message will be rejected.

                                        This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type
                                        doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249
                                        characters as per recent Kafka spec and allowed characters are
                                        a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, . and _.

                                        Older Kafka versions had longer topic lengths of 255, but in Kafka 0.10
                                        version the length was changed from 255 to 249. For compatibility
                                        reasons we are using 255.

                  this causes all traffic not explicitly allowed by a network policy

                                        - "*" matches 0 or more DNS valid characters, and may occur anywhere in
                                        the pattern. As a special case a "*" as the leftmost character, without a
                                        following "." matches all subdomains as well as the name to the right.
                                        A trailing "." is automatically added when missing.

                                        From Kafka protocol documentation:
                                        This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The
                                        user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when

                                        number coming from each client application (each of which could
                                        reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping
                                        across all requests from a particular client.

                                        If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                                        or "consume". A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required

                          L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs.
                          The DNS -> IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the
                          cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy
                          for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way).
                          Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as
                          ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when

                                          MatchPattern allows using wildcards to match DNS names. All wildcards are

                                          - "*" matches 0 or more DNS valid characters, and may occur anywhere in
                                          the pattern. As a special case a "*" as the leftmost character, without a

                                          From Kafka protocol documentation:
                                          This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The
                                          user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when
                                          logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might
                                          want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the
                                          number coming from each client application (each of which could
                                          reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping
                                          across all requests from a particular client.

                                          If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                                          or "consume". A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required
                                          to perform the specified higher-level operation.

                                          Topic is the topic name contained in the message. If a Kafka request

                                          This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type
                                          doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249

                                          - "*" matches 0 or more DNS valid characters, and may occur anywhere in
                                          the pattern. As a special case a "*" as the leftmost character, without a

                                          From Kafka protocol documentation:
                                          This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The
                                          user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when
                                          logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might
                                          want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the
                                          number coming from each client application (each of which could
                                          reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping
                                          across all requests from a particular client.

                                          If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                                          or "consume". A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required

                                          This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type
                                          doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249

                        ToFQDN allows whitelisting DNS names in place of IPs. The IPs that result
                        from DNS resolution of `ToFQDN.MatchName`s are added to the same
                        EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and
                        L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs.
                        The DNS -> IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the
                        cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy
                        for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way).
                        Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as
                        ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when
                        PolicyEnforcment=default.
                        Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the
                        ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP.
                        Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules.

                                        From Kafka protocol documentation:
                                        This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The
                                        user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when
                                        logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might
                                        want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the
                                        number coming from each client application (each of which could
                                        reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping
                                        across all requests from a particular client.

                                        If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                                        or "consume". A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required

                  this causes all traffic not explicitly allowed by a network policy
                  to be dropped.

                  If not specified, the default is true for each traffic direction
                  that has rules, and false otherwise. For example, if a policy

                  ingress is true and egress is false.

                  If multiple policies apply to an endpoint, that endpoint's default deny
                  will be enabled if any policy requests it.

                  This is useful for creating broad-based network policies that will not

                                        MatchPattern allows using wildcards to match DNS names. All wildcards are
                                        case insensitive. The wildcards are:
                                        - "*" matches 0 or more DNS valid characters, and may occur anywhere in
                                        the pattern. As a special case a "*" as the leftmost character, without a
                                        following "." matches all subdomains as well as the name to the right.
                                        A trailing "." is automatically added when missing.

                                        From Kafka protocol documentation:
                                        This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The
                                        user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when
                                        logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might
                                        want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the
                                        number coming from each client application (each of which could
                                        reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping
                                        across all requests from a particular client.

                                        If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                                        or "consume". A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required
                                        to perform the specified higher-level operation.

                                        doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249

                          L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs.
                          The DNS -> IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the
                          cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy
                          for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way).
                          Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as
                          ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when

                          ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP.
                          Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules.

                                          MatchPattern allows using wildcards to match DNS names. All wildcards are
                                          case insensitive. The wildcards are:
                                          - "*" matches 0 or more DNS valid characters, and may occur anywhere in
                                          the pattern. As a special case a "*" as the leftmost character, without a
                                          following "." matches all subdomains as well as the name to the right.
                                          A trailing "." is automatically added when missing.

                                          ClientID is the client identifier as provided in the request.

                                          From Kafka protocol documentation:
                                          This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The
                                          user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when
                                          logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might
                                          want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the
                                          number coming from each client application (each of which could
                                          reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping
                                          across all requests from a particular client.

                                          If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                          is allowed to initiate connections to in addition to connections

                          connections. Adding a prefix into ToCIDR or into ToCIDRSet with no

                          rule is allowed to receive connections from. Only connections which
                          do *not* originate from the cluster or from the local host are subject
                          to CIDR rules. In order to allow in-cluster connectivity, use the
                          FromEndpoints field.  This will match on the source IP address of
                          incoming connections. Adding  a prefix into FromCIDR or into

                          allowed between FromCIDR and FromCIDRSet.

                                          MatchPattern allows using wildcards to match DNS names. All wildcards are

                                          - "*" matches 0 or more DNS valid characters, and may occur anywhere in
                                          the pattern. As a special case a "*" as the leftmost character, without a
                                          following "." matches all subdomains as well as the name to the right.

                                          ClientID is the client identifier as provided in the request.

                                          From Kafka protocol documentation:
                                          This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The
                                          user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when
                                          logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might
                                          want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the
                                          number coming from each client application (each of which could
                                          reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping
                                          across all requests from a particular client.

                                          If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                                          Role is a case-insensitive string and describes a group of API keys
                                          necessary to perform certain higher-level Kafka operations such as "produce"
                                          or "consume". A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required
                                          to perform the specified higher-level operation.

                                          The following values are supported:

                                           - "consume": Allow consuming from the topics specified in the rule

                                          This field is incompatible with the APIKey field, i.e APIKey and Role
                                          cannot both be specified in the same rule.

                                          Topic is the topic name contained in the message. If a Kafka request
                                          contains multiple topics, then all topics must be allowed or the
                                          message will be rejected.

                                          This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type
                                          doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249

                          from which traffic should not be allowed.
                          This will match on the source IP address of incoming connections. Adding
                          a prefix into FromCIDR or into FromCIDRSet with no ExcludeCIDRs is
                          equivalent. Overlaps are allowed between FromCIDR and FromCIDRSet.

                          Example:
                          Any endpoint with the label "app=my-legacy-pet" is allowed to receive
                          connections from 10.0.0.0/8 except from IPs in subnet 10.96.0.0/12.
